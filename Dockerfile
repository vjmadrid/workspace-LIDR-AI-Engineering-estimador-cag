# Stage 1 — Builder
# =============================================================================
# We use a multi-stage build so that build tools (uv, compilers, headers) stay
# out of the final image, keeping it small and reducing the attack surface.
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder

# Install uv — a fast Python package manager written in Rust.
# Copying the static binary from the official image is the fastest method.
COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /uvx /bin/

WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency manifests first. Docker caches each layer, so dependencies
# are only reinstalled when pyproject.toml or uv.lock actually change.
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock* ./

# Install production dependencies only (no dev tools like pytest/ruff).
# --frozen ensures uv respects the lockfile without modifying it.
# --no-install-project skips installing our own package (we just need deps).
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --no-dev


# =============================================================================
# Stage 2 — Runtime
# =============================================================================
# Start from a clean slim image — no build tools, no uv, no cached layers
# from the builder stage. Only the virtual environment is carried over.

# process has minimal filesystem and OS-level privileges.

# Bring in the pre-built virtual environment from the builder stage.

# Ensure the non-root user owns everything it needs to run.
